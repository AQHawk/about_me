  So, let's see. My name is Adrian Hawk. I was born and raised in Salina, Kansas. There's not much to say about Salina, that anyone describing a town in the midwest hasn't already said. In my early twenties, after bartending for a few years, I grew restless and wanted to travel a bit, then go to college. I decided to serve my country for a few years, get the GI Bill and travel the world a bit in the process. My 4 year enlistment turned into a full 20 years. I loved the tempo and the constant change. I met a lot of great people, was constantly challenged and was never bored. Needless to say, I've travelled the world many times over and now, I'm finally using my GI Bill.

  After leaving the military in 2009, I went to work for Tri-Lakes Board of REALTORS as an IT. After a year, the 9 Multi-Listing Systems in the area combined to make a  Regional MLS and I had successfully worked myself out of a job by moving our operations from the LAN into the cloud. After my position was no longer needed, I went to work as an IT for HomeServices of America managing 5 REALTOR offices in SW Missouri, but I finally tired of IT work with that position. I spent most of my time fixing anything and everything tech related. The work no longer fed my soul. I was bored.

  I had built a website back in the Geocity days and then another inter-lan one using Coffee Cup editor a few years later. I remembered how much I liked creating them and thought Web Development would be a perfect transition from fixing tech to creating the tech that powers it.

  So, I sold my home in SW Missouri and moved to the NW to surround myself in the Dev world and persue the education needed for a new career. After finishing a degree in Web Dev and Design in Portland, I've moved to Seattle to get serious about coding by attending Code Fellows. After only two days, I can see it's going to be very challenging,...but very rewarding.
